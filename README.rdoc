= Net::LDAP for Ruby {<img src="https://travis-ci.org/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap.png" />}[https://travis-ci.org/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap]

== Description

Net::LDAP for Ruby (also called net-ldap) implements client access for the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), an IETF standard protocol for
accessing distributed directory services. Net::LDAP is written completely in
Ruby with no external dependencies. It supports most LDAP client features and a
subset of server features as well.

Net::LDAP has been tested against modern popular LDAP servers including
OpenLDAP and Active Directory. The current release is mostly compliant with
earlier versions of the IETF LDAP RFCs (2251–2256, 2829–2830, 3377, and 3771).
Our roadmap for Net::LDAP 1.0 is to gain full <em>client</em> compliance with
the most recent LDAP RFCs (4510–4519, plus portions of 4520–4532).

* {ruby-ldap@googlegroups.com}[http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-ldap]

== Synopsis

See Net::LDAP for documentation and usage samples.

== Requirements

Net::LDAP requires a Ruby 2.0.0 compatible interpreter or better.

== Install

Net::LDAP is a pure Ruby library. It does not require any external libraries.
You can install the RubyGems version of Net::LDAP available from the usual
sources.

  gem install net-ldap

Simply require either 'net-ldap' or 'net/ldap'.

== Extensions

This library focuses on the core LDAP RFCs referenced in the description.
However, we recognize there are commonly used extensions to the spec that are
useful. If there is another library which handles it, we list it here.

* {resolv-srv}[https://rubygems.org/gems/resolv-srv]: Support RFC2782 SRV record lookup and failover

== Develop

This task will run the test suite and the
{RuboCop}[https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop] static code analyzer.

  rake rubotest

CI takes too long? If your local box supports
{Vagrant}[https://www.vagrantup.com/], you can run most of the tests
in a VM on your local box. For more details and setup instructions, see
{test/support/vm/openldap/README.md}[https://github.com/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap/tree/master/test/support/vm/openldap/README.md]
